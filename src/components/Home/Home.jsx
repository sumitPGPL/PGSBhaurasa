              As we know that education is a lifelong process in our present
              scenario, no one can imagine education without the digital skills.
              Development in artificial intelligence, robotics and genetic
              engineering is making the current workforce redundant and only
              those who are able to learn and train themselves with these
              technologies will be able to continue forward. At Pratibha Global
              Indore School we ensure that all children at our campus inculcate
              a rapid learning aptitude and a competitive spirit from the very
              beginning. Pratibha Global Indore School aims to provide a
              holistic education and conducive atmosphere to every child for
              their emotional, spiritual, physical and intellectual growth along
              with the ability to conquer future challenges.
