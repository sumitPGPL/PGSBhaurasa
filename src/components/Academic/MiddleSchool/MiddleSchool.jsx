            <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
              In the dynamic stage of child development spanning classes 6-8,
              often referred to as the "Pratibha Stage," children undergo a
              multifaceted transformation across various domains. Physically,
              this period witnesses the onset of puberty, introducing
              significant changes such as growth spurts and the development of
              secondary sexual characteristics. Concurrently, cognitive
              abilities blossom, enabling students to engage in abstract
              thinking, problem-solving, and critical reasoning. As academic
              demands intensify, middle schoolers embark on a journey of subject
              specialization, delving deeper into specific disciplines.
